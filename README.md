Predicting Medical Insurance Costs: A Linear Regression Analysis


## Introduction

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using linear regression. The model is trained on the "Medical Cost Personal Datasets" dataset, which includes information such as age, BMI, smoker status, and more. The goal is to estimate medical insurance charges based on individual characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available at [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). Please refer to the dataset's source for more details and licensing information.

## Project Overview

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling if necessary.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset's characteristics, including summary statistics and visualizations.
- Model Building: Constructing a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Model Evaluation: Calculating evaluation metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
- Visualization: Visualizing the actual vs. predicted insurance charges and correlation matrix.
